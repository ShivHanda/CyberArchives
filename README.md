## 📂 The Asset (The Data)
The core of this project is the **Continuous Intelligence Ledger**. Unlike transient feeds that disappear, this dataset grows indefinitely.

### **👉 [Access the Master Dataset (`threat_data.csv`)](./threat_data.csv)**

**The dataset contains high-fidelity records of:**
* **Timestamp (UTC):** Exact moment of vector detection.
* **IP Address:** The malicious actor.
* **Geolocation:** City, Country, and Coordinates.
* **Network Intel:** ISP (e.g., China Telecom) and Organization.
* **Usage Type:** Identification of Data Center (Botnets) vs Residential (Infected Devices).

## ⚡ The Engine (Zero-Touch Automation)

This system is engineered to function as a **Perpetual Machine**. It requires zero human maintenance.

* **Autonomous Surveillance:** Powered by **GitHub Actions Cron Jobs**, the system wakes up automatically every **120 minutes**.
* **Smart Orchestration:** It scouts for new global threats, enriches them with Geolocation & ISP metadata, and securely commits them to the CSV vault.
* **Self-Sustaining:** It handles rate limits, data merging, and repository updates—**all without a single manual click.**

## 👁️ Quick Visualizer
While the CSV is the primary product, you can audit the latest intel visually.

## 🚀 Need Real-Time Situational Awareness?

If you are impressed by this historical vault, check out our **Live Monitor**.

While **CyberArchives** is built for *Data Preservation* and *Analysis*, our sister project **Live-DDOS** handles *Real-Time Traffic Analysis* with a completely different "Cyberpunk" aesthetic.
